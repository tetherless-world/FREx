# FREx - A **F**ramework for **R**ecommendations with **Ex**planations

FREx is a Python package created to support the development of recommender systems,
particularly those that (1) use knowledge-driven processes, (2) utilize RDF data
sources, and (3) want to provide users with explanations about why the final 
recommendation was given to them.

This website documents some of the key features and motivations of FREx, as
well as a simple walkthrough to get started with using it in a new project.

We also present two implementation examples of of recommender systems, for
the domains of [university course recommendation](/pages/escore.html) and 
[healthy food recommendation](/pages/food.html).  

This is the main repository for providing a homepage for all things surrounding the FREx package.

A proper webpage version of the documenation content can be found here (TODO)

The the actual FREx package can be found [here](https://github.com/solashirai/explainablerecommenderframework).
